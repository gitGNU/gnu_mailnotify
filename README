1. About Mail Notification

	Mail Notification is an icon for the GNOME Notification Area
	that informs users if they have new mail.

	In order to display the icon in the Notification Area, Mail
	Notification uses the EggTrayIcon backend, which adheres to
	the freedesktop's System Tray Specification
	(http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/systemtray-spec). This
	might allow Mail Notification to function with other trays
	implementing that specification, such as the KDE System Tray
	or the XFce 4 system tray. However, Mail Notification has only
	been tested with the GNOME Notification Area.

	Features:

		* multiple folder support
		* mbox, MH, Maildir and Sylpheed support
		* POP3 support (if the GNet library is available)
		* automatic folder format detection
		* responsive UI (multi-threaded application)
		* HIG-compliant user interface
		* themeable stock icons

	Usage:

		Right-click the mail icon to access the popup menu.

		The two GTK+ stock icons are named
		"mail-notification-no-mail" and
		"mail-notification-mail" (see
		http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-Resource-Files.html
		for details about how to customize them in your
		~/.gtkrc-2.0).

		If the program does not work as expected, run it from
		a terminal and watch for possible error messages.

2. Release notes

	A bug in the mbox checking code has been fixed (thanks to Pau
	Artigas for reporting it).
