1. About Mail Notification

	Mail Notification is a status icon (aka tray icon) that
	informs you if you have new mail.

	It works with system trays implementing the freedesktop.org
	System Tray Specification, such as the GNOME Panel
	Notification Area, the Xfce Notification Area and the KDE
	System Tray.

	Mail Notification features include:

		* multiple mailbox support
		* mbox, MH, Maildir, POP3, IMAP, Gmail, Evolution and
		  Sylpheed support
		* SASL authentication support
		* APOP authentication support
		* SSL/TLS support
		* automatic detection of mailbox format
		* immediate notification (the status icon is updated
		  immediately or within seconds after a mailbox
		  changes)
		* a mail summary
		* HIG 2.0 compliance

2. Issues in third-party software affecting Mail Notification

	* Thread-safety bugs in libgnomeui may cause Mail Notification
	  (and other multi-threaded GNOME applications) to crash or
	  hang.

	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152023
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312180

	* An infinite loop in GnomeVFS may affect mailboxes which use
	  HTTP authentication (for instance, Gmail mailboxes).

	  (fixed on 20050723)

	* An unidentified bug, probably in the Metacity window
	  manager, may sometimes cause the mail summary popup to be
	  misplaced.
