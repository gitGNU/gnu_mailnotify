1. About Mail Notification

	Mail Notification is a status icon (aka tray icon) that
	informs you if you have new mail.

	It works with system trays implementing the freedesktop.org
	System Tray Specification, such as the GNOME Panel
	Notification Area, the Xfce Notification Area and the KDE
	System Tray.

	Mail Notification features include:

		- multiple mailbox support
		- mbox, MH, Maildir, Sylpheed and POP3 support
		- automatic detection of mailbox format
		- automatic notification
		- HIG compliance

2. Release notes
