1. About Mail Notification

	Mail Notification is a status icon (aka tray icon) that
	informs you if you have new mail.

	It works with system trays implementing the freedesktop.org
	System Tray Specification, such as the GNOME Panel
	Notification Area, the Xfce Notification Area and the KDE
	System Tray.

	Mail Notification features include:

		* multiple mailbox support
		* mbox, MH, Maildir, Sylpheed, POP3, IMAP and Gmail
		  support
		* SASL authentication support
		* APOP authentication support
		* SSL/TLS support
		* automatic detection of mailbox format
		* immediate notification (the status icon is updated
		  within seconds after a mailbox changes)
		* a mail summary
		* HIG 2.0 compliance

2. Issues in third-party software affecting Mail Notification

	As of March 1, 2005, the following issues are unfixed, and may
	cause Mail Notification (and other GNOME multi-threaded
	programs) to crash or hang.

	* thread-safety bug in GLib:
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64764

	  Reported on 2001-11-17, maintainers apparently do not care.

	* thread-safety bugs in libgnomeui:
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152023

	  Reported on 2004-09-06, patches provided, maintainers
	  apparently do not care.
