3.0 Release Candidate 1			May 16, 2006

	* Core changes:
		* An alternate, compact mail summary has been added
		* A "Display seen messages" option has been added
		* The status icon can now be displayed permanently
		* The "Delay between mail checks" option is now
		  mailbox-specific
		* The properties dialog has been reorganized
		* The main window has been removed
		* The status icon is now activated with a single click
		  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148829)
		* The GTK+ bugs
		  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321886)
		  which caused occasional crashes have been worked
		  around
		* If the MAIL environment variable is not defined or
		  invalid, the system mailbox is now looked up in
		  /var/spool/mail/username and /var/mail/username
		  (based on a patch from Benoît Rouits)
		* Since ~/.gnome2/mail-notification/mailboxes.xml may
		  contain sensitive information, it is now saved with
		  permissions set to 0600 (useful for systems where
		  home directories have lax permissions)
		* The "cannot enable immediate notification" error
		  dialog has been removed
		* The --list-features command line option has been
		  removed (feature information is now displayed in the
		  output of the --version option)
		* The message handling performance has been improved
		* If there are no mailboxes on startup, the properties
		  dialog is now displayed
		* The "Start Mail Notification on GNOME login" option
		  no longer worked with GNOME >= 2.14 and has been
		  removed: a .desktop file is now installed in the xdg
		  autostart directory instead
		* Since support for non-system sound events has been
		  removed from GNOME 2.14, the
		  mail-notification.soundlist file is no longer
		  installed
		* The mail reader setting has been removed; the mail
		  reader configured in GNOME (Desktop -> Preferences
		  -> Preferred Applications) will now be used
		* The tooltip width is now limited to the screen width
		* When coupled with a patched GNOME Panel (as shipped
		  by FreeBSD and Debian, for instance), the status
		  icon now supports panel transparency (patch
		  forwarded by Bernat Tallaferro)

	* mbox, Maildir, POP3, IMAP, Evolution and Sylpheed changes:
		* Messages are now classified as unseen and seen; seen
		  messages can be ignored by unchecking the "Display
		  seen mail" option

	* mbox changes:
		* Compressed mailboxes (gzip and bzip2) are now
		  handled transparently, and support immediate
		  notification

	* POP3, IMAP and Gmail changes:
		* A regression which allowed mail checks to overlap
		  has been fixed

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* If the server advertises the STLS/STARTTLS
		  capability but replies ERR/BAD when the
		  STLS/STARTTLS command is issued, Mail Notification
		  now logs out instead of proceeding
		* If multiple mailboxes have the same type, hostname,
		  port, connection type and username, Mail
		  Notification will now detect that the mailboxes
		  share the same account and will only prompt for the
		  password once per session (when the password is not
		  entered in the properties dialog, that is)

	* POP3 changes:
		* Non-UTF-8 server responses are now accepted

	* IMAP changes:
		* Non-ASCII server responses are now accepted (these
		  responses violate RFC 3501, but we follow the RFC
		  793 robustness principle "be liberal in what you
		  accept"); fixes connection problems with
		  internationalized Exchange servers, which violate
		  RFC 3501 by sending non-ASCII characters in their
		  greeting message
		* Empty continuation responses are now allowed (fixes
		  authentication with some SASL mechanisms)
		* Play nice with uncompliant servers by using
		  BODY.PEEK rather than BODY, so that they do not set
		  the \Seen flag (patch from Jacob Berkman)
		* The IDLE mode is now cycled every 29 minutes, as
		  advised by RFC 2177

	* Evolution changes:
		* Support for the Evolution 2.4 and 2.6 branches has
		  been added; untested support for the Evolution
		  2.7/2.8 branch has been added; the Evolution source
		  tree is no longer needed for Evolution >= 2.4

	* Sylpheed changes:
		* With the help of a Sylpheed patch, Mail Notification
		  can now reliably avoid race conditions which could
		  occur when Sylpheed was running (see the
		  --enable-sylpheed-locking discussion in the INSTALL
		  file)

	* Updated translations:
		* French

	* New translations:
		* Czech (Pav Lucistnik)
		* Brazilian Portuguese (Claudio André)
		* Dutch (Marcel J. Zwiebel)
		* Japanese (Hiroshi Hasebe)

2.0					August 9, 2005

	* Core changes:
		* Evolution support has been added
		* Mailboxes can now be assigned a custom name
		* For greater flexibility, mailboxes configuration is
		  now stored in ~/.gnome2/mail-notification/mailboxes.xml
		  (previously, it was stored in the GConf database)
		* The mailbox list widget has been redesigned
		* The mailbox properties dialog has been redesigned
		* Copying a mailbox to the clipboard does not make it
		  available to Nautilus anymore: that behaviour was
		  confusing and useless. However, pasting files copied
		  from Nautilus still works.
		* If a mailbox requires authentication and the
		  necessary credentials are not provided in the
		  mailbox properties dialog, Mail Notification now
		  lets GNOME prompt the user for the credentials
		* A test popup can now be displayed from the Mail
		  Summary Popup properties tab
		* The --report command line option has been removed
		* The Mail Notification item is now also listed in the
		  GNOME >= 2.10 Preferences menu
		* The welcome dialog has been removed
		* A few icons have been modified
		* The third-party libegg code has been updated
		* Now requires GTK+ version 2.6.0 or superior
		* Minor fixes and cleanups

	* mbox, MH, Maildir and Sylpheed changes:
		* Immediate notification did not work properly with
		  fast kernel notifiers (kqueue, inotify, dnotify,
		  ...): fixed
		* Unseekable files are now supported
		* Mailbox type changes are now detected and handled
		  (previously, Mail Notification had to be restarted
		  if a mailbox changed type)
		* The location of the system mailbox is now resolved
		  at runtime rather than when the mailbox is added
		  (eases sharing the Mail Notification settings across
		  multiple computers)

	* mbox changes:
		* When immediate notification is not available, the
		  mailbox is now also checked when its size or ctime
		  changes (previously, it was only checked if its
		  mtime had changed)

	* Sylpheed changes:
		* Mail Notification now tries to avoid race conditions
		  which may occur while Sylpheed is being used
		* Mark file errors are not ignored anymore
		* A memory leak has been fixed

	* POP3, IMAP and Gmail changes:
		* The username can now also be left out, and will be
		  prompted when needed

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* Non-UTF-8 characters are now escaped from
		  uncompliant server responses before being displayed
		  in the user interface
		* If the system resolver is not reentrant,
		  getaddrinfo()/getnameinfo() calls are now serialized
		* The Cyrus SASL library is now initialized only once,
		  since multiple sasl_client_init()/sasl_done()
		  invocations may cause problems (another benefit is
		  that it allows the SASL library to use the POP3
		  initial client response feature, which saves a
		  roundtrip during the SASL authentication exchange)
		* When the authentication mechanism option is set to
		  "autodetect", Mail Notification will now try to
		  authenticate using each server-supported SASL
		  mechanism
		* Mail Notification was incorrectly disallowing empty
		  SASL server challenges, although they are legit:
		  fixed

	* POP3 changes:
		* The TOP optional command is now supported. This
		  solves some issues with POP3 servers (for instance,
		  pop.gmail.com) which incorrectly archive mails that
		  have been accessed using the RETR command.
		* Initial SASL client responses are now handled
		  properly (passed as an argument to the AUTH command
		  rather than in the SASL authentication exchange)

	* IMAP changes:
		* If, while idling, the server abruptly drops the
		  connection, Mail Notification now reconnects rather
		  than considering it an error
		* When idling, Mail Notification now only wakes up if
		  it receives a response indicating that the mailbox
		  might have changed
		* By default, Mail Notification now avoids using the
		  IDLE extension if the remote server software is
		  known to have a broken IDLE implementation
		* UTF-8 mailbox names are now converted to modified
		  UTF-7, as required by RFC 3501

	* Gmail changes:
		* Functionality has been restored after the Gmail web
		  site was modified; to prevent future disruptions and
		  simplify the source code, the Gmail Atom feed
		  (https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom) is now used
		* Now works even if the Gmail account language is not
		  set to English
		* libsoup and ICU are no longer required

	* Updated translations:
		* French
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* German (Hendrik Brandt, Jens Seidel)

	  added: fixes a few random crashes
	* Some widgets have been named, so that they can easily be
	  matched in a GTK+ resource file
